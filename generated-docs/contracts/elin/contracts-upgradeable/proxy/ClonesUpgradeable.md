# ClonesUpgradeable







*https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167[EIP 1167] is a standard for deploying minimal proxy contracts, also known as &quot;clones&quot;. &gt; To simply and cheaply clone contract functionality in an immutable way, this standard specifies &gt; a minimal bytecode implementation that delegates all calls to a known, fixed address. The library includes functions to deploy a proxy using either `create` (traditional deployment) or `create2` (salted deterministic deployment). It also includes functions to predict the addresses of clones deployed using the deterministic method. _Available since v3.4._*
