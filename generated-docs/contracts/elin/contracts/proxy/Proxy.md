# Proxy







*This abstract contract provides a fallback function that delegates all calls to another contract using the EVM instruction `delegatecall`. We refer to the second contract as the _implementation_ behind the proxy, and it has to be specified by overriding the virtual {_implementation} function. Additionally, delegation to the implementation can be triggered manually through the {_fallback} function, or to a different contract through the {_delegate} function. The success and return data of the delegated call will be returned back to the caller of the proxy.*
