### Networks Supported

The project has been configured to support the following networks.
All the deploy scripts will expect network param to know which network the contract deployment / interaction should take place

#### Main Networks

| network            | chain id | network name |
|--------------------|--|--------------------|
| `mainnet`     | `1`  | Ethereum Mainnet    |
| `pgn`    | `424`  | Public Goods Network    |
| `optimism` | `10` | Optimism |
| `arbitrum`   | `42161` | Arbitrum One   |
| `celo`   | `42220` | Celo   |
| `zksync-era`  | `324` | zkSync Era  |
| `base`    | `84531`  | Base  |
| `polygon`    | `137`  | Polygon PoS  |

#### Test Networks

| network            | chain id | network name       |
|--------------------|--|--------------------|
| `goerli`          | `5`  | Goerli PoW Testnet |
| `sepolia`          | `11155111`  | Sepolia PoS Testnet |

### Setup && Install Dependencies

1. Create an `.env` file and populate the .env file
```sh
cp ../.env.sample ../.env
```

2. Install dependencies
```shell
bun install
```

3. Install Foundry [Install Docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
   ðŸ¤š Only do this if you don't have it installed already, by running the `bun compile`
   command, it will update libs for you.
```shell
foundryup
```

1. Compile Contracts
```shell
bun compile
```

1. Running Tests

The tests have been written in foundry.
For detailed information on how the testing framework works, refer [Test Options](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-test#test-options)

Run all tests without verbosity
```bash
bun test
bun test -vvvv # with verbosity
bun test -vvvv --match-test <test_name> # specific test
bun test -vvvv --match-contract <contract_name> # specific contract
# the two above can be used together to dial into a specific test
```

7. Coverage

```bash
buncoverage # generate coverage on terminal
buncoverage:html # generate lcov coverage on html
```


### Deploying Project Registry

The section here shows how to set up the project registry for the first time on a given network. Ideally these steps would be done once per chain. In this example, we would be deploying on goerli.

1. Deploy the `Registry` contract
```shell
 npx hardhat run scripts/deployRegistry.ts --network goerli
```

### Deploying Allo

The section here shows how to deploy the Allo contract on a given network. In this example, we would be deploying on goerli.

1. Deploy the `Allo` contract
```shell
 npx hardhat run scripts/deployAllo.ts --network goerli
```

### Contract Verification

1. Run the verify command
```shell
npx hardhat verify --network goerli <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "<ARGS>" "<ARGS>" "<ARGS>"
```
