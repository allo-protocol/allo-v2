### Networks Supported

The project has been configured to support the following networks.
All the deploy scripts will expect network param to know which network the contract deployment / interaction should take place

#### Main Networks

| network            | chain id | network name |
|--------------------|--|--------------------|
| `mainnet`     | `1`  | Ethereum Mainnet    |
| `pgn`    | `424`  | Public Goods Network    |
| `optimism` | `10` | Optimism |
| `arbitrum`   | `42161` | Arbitrum One   |
| `celo`   | `42220` | Celo   |
| `base`    | `84531`  | Base  |
| `polygon`    | `137`  | Polygon PoS  |

#### Test Networks

| network            | chain id | network name       |
|--------------------|--|--------------------|
| `goerli`          | `5`  | Goerli PoW Testnet |
| `sepolia`          | `11155111`  | Sepolia PoS Testnet |
| `base-testnet`          | `84531`  | Base Testnet  |
| `polygon-mumbai`          | `80001`  | Polygon Mumbai Testnet |
| `arbitrum-sepolia`| `421614` | Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet |
| `celo-alfajores`   | `44787` | Celo Alfajores Testnet   |
| `optimism-goerli`   | `420` | Optimism Goerli Testnet  |
| `pgn-testnet`   | `58008` |    |

### Setup && Install Dependencies

1. Create an `.env` file and populate the .env file
```sh
cp ../.env.sample ../.env
```

2. Install dependencies
```shell
bun install
```

3. Install Foundry [Install Docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
   ðŸ¤š Only do this if you don't have it installed already, by running the `bun compile`
   command, it will update libs for you.
```shell
foundryup
```

1. Compile Contracts
```shell
bun run build
```

1. Running Tests

The tests have been written in foundry.
For detailed information on how the testing framework works, refer [Test Options](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-test#test-options)

Run all tests without verbosity
```bash
bun test
bun test -vvvv # with verbosity
bun test -vvvv --match-test <test_name> # specific test
bun test -vvvv --match-contract <contract_name> # specific contract
# the two above can be used together to dial into a specific test
```

7. Coverage

```bash
buncoverage # generate coverage on terminal
buncoverage:html # generate lcov coverage on html
```

### Deploying Core Contracts across all networks

    deployAllNetworks.sh --> Deploy-ContractFactory --> DeployRegistry --> DeployAllo --> TransferProxyAdminOwnership
```

- Ensure the configuration has been set in 
   - `allo.config.ts`
   - `registry.config.ts`
   - `common.config.ts`
- Check `./scripts/core/deployAllNetworks.sh` and ensure the networks you need to deploy on are uncommented
- Run `./scripts/core/deployAllNetworks.sh`
- This should deploy and generate the log for the deployments for 
   - ContractFactory
   - Registry
   - Allo
   - and update the AlloProxyAdmin 


### Upgrading Core Contracts across all networks

- Ensure the patch fix has been made
- Check `./scripts/core/upgrades/upgradeAllNetworks.sh` and ensure the networks you need to deploy on are uncommented
- Run `./scripts/core/upgrades/upgradeAllNetworks.sh allo` to upgrade Allo contracts
- Run `./scripts/core/upgrades/upgradeAllNetworks.sh registry` to upgrade Registry contracts


### Propose Upgrading Core Contracts across all networks

- Ensure the patch fix has been made
- Check `./scripts/core/upgrades/proposeUpgradeAllNetworks.sh` and ensure the networks you need to deploy on are uncommented
- Run `./scripts/core/upgrades/proposeUpgradeAllNetworks.sh allo` to propose an upgrade on Allo contract
- Run `./scripts/core/upgrades/proposeUpgradeAllNetworks.sh registry` to propose an upgrade on Registry contract

### Deploying Strategies across all networks

- Check `./_deployAllStrategies.ts` to the strategies to be deployed are included.
- Check `./scripts/strategies/deployAllStrategies.sh` and ensure the networks you need to deploy on are uncommented
- Run `./scripts/strategies/deployAllStrategies.sh`
- This should deploy and generate the log for the deployments for all the strategies

Note: The strategies need to be marked as approved strategies on the Allo contract which has to be done by the owner. If you are replacing an existing strategy, ensure the old one is unapproved
