# Contract Upgrade Runbook/Research

#### Contract Owner Research:

##### üö® Use a Separate Account for the Transparent Proxy Admin:
The proxy admin and logic governance should be separate addresses to prevent loss of interaction with the logical implementation. If the proxy admin and logical governance reference the same address, no call will be forwarded to execute the privileged functions, sealing change of governance functionality [[ 1 ]](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/FnfYrOCsy3MG9s9gixfbJ-upgradeable-proxy-contract-security-best-practices).

#### Defender:

‚úÖ Open Zeppelin Defender is an option as a tool to manage the upgrades and roles of the Allo and Registry cotracts. [Defender v2](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/introducing-openzeppelin-defender-2-0) will offer SAFE support with the ability to [upgrade from a Gnosis SAFE](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-app-for-gnosis-safe).
