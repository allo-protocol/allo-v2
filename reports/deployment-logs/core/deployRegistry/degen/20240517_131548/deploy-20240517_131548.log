Could not find an event with any of the following topics in the logs for address 0x4AAcca72145e1dF2aeC137E1f3C5E3D75DB8b5f3: AdminChanged(address,address), Upgraded(address)

If the proxy was recently deployed, the transaction may not be available on Etherscan yet. Try running the verify task again after waiting a few blocks.
Failed to verify directly using hardhat verify: The contract you want to verify was compiled with solidity 0.8.9, but your configured compiler version is: 0.8.19.

Possible causes are:
- You are not in the same commit that was used to deploy the contract.
- Wrong compiler version selected in hardhat config.
- The given address is wrong.
- The selected network (degen) is wrong.
